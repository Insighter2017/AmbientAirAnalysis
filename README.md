# Ambient Air Analysis
### Observations:  Overall there is a downward trend in motor emissions and coal pollution based on this set.

######  The purpose of these visualizations is to discover whether emissions and pollutants decreased over a six-year period.
######  For motor emissions, I used Baltimore City (Maryland) and LA County (California), and U.S. nationwide.
######  For coal pollutants, I charted the U.S. nationwide.
